# 4DChess
This is an unfinished prototype for an unpublished game. It is playable chess game on a 4-Dimensional chess board (4x4x4x4) and made in Unity. Pieces can move forward/back, left/right, up/down and forward/backward between 3D spaces through the 4th dimension. 

The game allows you to play against an AI opponent and see the 4 dimensional chess board as any of the 6 valid 2-dimensional projections such that any move can be visualized as its 2 dimensional equivalent.
